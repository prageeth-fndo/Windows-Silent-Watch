# üñ•Ô∏è Windows Silent Watch

This project automates the process of capturing screenshots from a Windows computer at fixed intervals and uploading them to a Google Drive folder. It uses PowerShell for logic, NirCmd for capturing, FFmpeg for video encoding, and rclone for cloud uploads. The solution runs silently in the background using VBScript wrappers and auto-starts via Windows Registry.

## üîß Requirements

- **[NirCmd](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html)** ‚Äì For capturing screenshots
- **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** ‚Äì For encoding screenshots into video
- **[rclone](https://rclone.org/)** ‚Äì For uploading files to Google Drive
- **PowerShell** ‚Äì Pre-installed on Windows

> Paths used in scripts:
> - NirCmd: `C:\WSW\nircmd\nircmd.exe`
> - FFmpeg: `C:\WSW\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe`
> - rclone: `C:\WSW\rclone\rclone.exe`
> - Screenshot folder: `C:\WSW\img\`

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Install NirCmd, FFmpeg, and rclone**  
   Place them in the correct folders as per the paths above.

2. **Configure rclone for Google Drive**  
   Follow rclone‚Äôs [Google Drive setup guide](https://rclone.org/drive/) to create a remote named `gdrive`.

3. **Edit Paths if Needed**  
   If your tools are in a different location, update the paths in the `.ps1` and `.vbs` files.

4. **Enable Auto-Start at Login**  
   - Double-click `Autorun.reg` to add the VBScript entries to the registry.
   - Alternatively, use Task Scheduler to trigger the VBS scripts at login.

5. **Manual Test Run**  
   - Run `ScreenCapture.vbs` to start taking screenshots silently.
   - Run `Uploader.vbs` to trigger the upload logic (at 4AM, 12PM or 8PM).

## üß© How It Works

- `ScreenCapture.ps1` captures a screenshot every 30 seconds using NirCmd and stores them as `img0001.png`, `img0002.png`, etc., in `C:\WSW\img\`.
- `Uploader.ps1` runs continuously and, at 04:00, 12:00 or 20:00, generates a video (15 fps) using FFmpeg and uploads it to Google Drive using rclone.
- After a successful upload, it deletes all screenshots and resets the counter.
